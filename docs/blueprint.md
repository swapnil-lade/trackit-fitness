## Style Guidelines:

- Accent color: Teal (#26A69A), an analogous color to the primary, adds sophistication and signals important interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and short amounts of text; 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clean, modern icons related to fitness, nutrition, and activity tracking.
- Clean, modern layout with a focus on data visualization.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback and enhance user experience.
